# Predict-how-many-medals-a-country-will-win-at-the-olympics-using-ML-and-Python
Steps of building an ML project using Python and Jupyter Notebook
Step 1: Form a hypothesis to disprove or prove the data used to predict how many medals a country will win in the olympics.
Step 2: Use data from datasets provided
Step 3: Reshape the data to make machine learning possible and create a column to predict medals the teams will win
Step 4: Clean the data to make it ready for ML by cleaning missing values and remove missing data
Step 5: Error Metric is used to evaluate performance of ML models, use Mean Absolute Error and take mean of absolute errors divided by values of predictions made to get mean of absolute error
Step 6: Split the data by training one part of the data, make predictions on the other part of data and give the algorithm a new set of data to train algorithm and show how well the algo makes predictions on test data
Step 7: Train a model by using linear regression ML model to train model, draw a line within points and use it to make predictions and also train linear regression model to make predictions on future data
